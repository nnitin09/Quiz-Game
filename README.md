‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ questions_en.js     # The database for all English questions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ questions_hi.js     # The database for all Hindi questions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # This file
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository (or download the files):**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

## ‚ùì How to Add More Questions

The question bank is separated into `questions_en.js` (English) and `questions_hi.js` (Hindi).

### Important Rules:
*   You **must** add the question to both `questions_en.js` and `questions_hi.js`.
*   The application does **not** automatically translate questions.
*   The answer (`a`) must exactly match one of the options in the options array (`o`).

### Steps to add a question:

1. **Open `questions_en.js`:**
   Add a new object to the `englishQuestions` array following this structure:

   ```javascript
   // Example: questions_en.js
   const englishQuestions = [
       // ... existing questions ...
       {
           q: "What is the capital of Japan?", // The Question
           o: ["Beijing", "Seoul", "Tokyo", "Bangkok"], // The Options array
           a: "Tokyo" // The Correct Answer
       }
   ];
   ```

2. **Open `questions_hi.js`:**
   Add the corresponding translated question to the `hindiQuestions` array:

   ```javascript
   // Example: questions_hi.js
   const hindiQuestions = [
       // ... existing questions ...
       {
           q: "‡§ú‡§æ‡§™‡§æ‡§® ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡§ß‡§æ‡§®‡•Ä ‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§π‡•à?", // The Question in Hindi
           o: ["‡§¨‡•Ä‡§ú‡§ø‡§Ç‡§ó", "‡§∏‡§ø‡§Ø‡•ã‡§≤", "‡§ü‡•ã‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡•ã", "‡§¨‡•à‡§Ç‡§ï‡•â‡§ï"], // Options in Hindi
           a: "‡§ü‡•ã‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡•ã" // Correct Answer in Hindi
       }
   ];
   ```
